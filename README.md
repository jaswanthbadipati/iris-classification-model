Project Description Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning  This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

üöÄ **Exploring the World of Machine Learning with Iris Flower Classification** üå∏  

Just completed an exciting project where I trained a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species ‚Äî *setosa, versicolor, and virginica*. Using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, I explored the power of data and algorithms to solve this classic classification problem.  

üîç Key Highlights:  
‚úÖ Loaded and preprocessed real-world data  
‚úÖ Trained a Random Forest Classifier with 80%+ accuracy  
‚úÖ Gained hands-on experience with model evaluation metrics like accuracy and classification reports  

Excited to share this journey and continue exploring innovative projects in data science and machine learning! üåü

### Project Description  
**Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning**  

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. The dataset used for this project consists of measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which serve as features for the classification task.  

**Key Steps:**  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded and cleaned the dataset, encoded categorical labels, and split the data into training and testing sets.  
- **Model Training:** Used a Random Forest Classifier to train on the dataset.  
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification reports, achieving high accuracy.  
- **Deployment Ready:** The trained model was saved and can be used for real-time predictions.  

This project demonstrates practical knowledge in data preprocessing, supervised learning, and model evaluation, showcasing the application of machine learning to solve real-world problems.
